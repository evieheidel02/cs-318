                    <h3>All About Me</h3>
                        <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Evie and welcome to my website. On here, you will find everything that is on a resume and so much more. Included but not limited to: work experience, schooling, some writing samples, media samples, and some other cool things that I think are super cool. </p>
                        <p>So who am I? That is the question, I’m sure that we are all here to find out. Well, since you asked so nicely, I am a 22 year old college student who is about to turn beginner adult in just 1 short month. Yes, I’m talking about GRADUATION! After my undergraduate degree is over and I close this chapter of the book, I will be moving onto (now say it with me) Corporate America! Whoot Whoot! Yeah! Living the high life baby. You heard it hear first, I will be wasting away in an office cubicle come August. On the bright side, the job I have will be so painstakingly boring so that I can fill up my time doing my true passion, Writing!</p>
                        <p>My dream job is to become a screenwriter, movie director, and intimacy coordinator for the film industry, and for that to happen, I need to build my portfolio. Over this next year, I will be building my creative portfolio so that I can use it and the works to apply for film school in 2026, which would then give me connections and familiarize myself with the movie making process.</p>
                        <p>Now, I’ve talked about myself quite a bit up to this point, and I would say something funny like “now enough about me” however, this is MY website so I’m going to keep going, if you don’t mind. </p>
                        <p>I have 3 pets, my dog: Epic and my two guinea pigs: Whiskey and Turbo that I share with my loving partner. In my free time I like to craft and emborder, rewatch tv shows like Criminal Minds and New Girl, and show my partner very common movies that somehow he has never seen before, like Harry Potter or Forrest Gump. I also enjoy indulging in a table top board game from time to time. Catan, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and Machi Koro are just some of my favorite go tos. Fun fact about me: when I was 15, I competed in a National Qualifying Catan Tournament and made it to the top 4 players, or the winner’s table. Everyone else I was playing with was well into their 30s or even 40s and had no idea how I had gotten there. What can I say, I’m just that good. I also enjoy hunting, fishing, and loving everyday, one of the many things that Luke Bryan and I have in common. </p>
                        <p>ANYWHO: I feel like I’ve talked your ear off for at least 6 minutes. (I pity your partner if you think 6 minutes is forever) but I really should move on… you however have to keep reading through this pretty sick awesome website that I cooked up here. I’ll leave you to it!</p>
