          <h2>Facts</h2>  
          <h3>Movie Magic</h3>
            <p>Every film or television show starts with an idea, concept, or existing material, such as a book, script, or real-life event. Creators can pitch their concept to producers, and from there, the idea evolves into a script; <br> producers secure funding for the project, actors are chosen to portray characters in the story, filmmakers search for suitable shooting locations, and visual representations of scenes are created to plan shots and sequences.</p>
            <p>A healthy budget can be vital during the filmmaking or television process. In Hollywood, more money can mean stronger special effects, more high-profile talent in front of and behind the camera, and more diverse and exciting locations to film on. <br> Employing many special effects to submerge audiences underwater, for example, the remake of The Little Mermaid in 2023, required a transformative process. It was essential during the post-production stage of filmmaking, as computer-generated imagery (CGI) and other visual effects were incorporated.</p>
          <h3>Weird Production</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Wizard of OZ, the snow in the poppy field scene was made from asbestos.</li>
                <li>In The Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen's pain in the movie was real. </li>
                <li>In Singin' in the Rain, Gene Kelly was sick while filming a famous scene in the movie. </li>
                <li>When the movie Titanic was released in 1997, film reels were still the only way to project a movie. <br>Each copy of the movie was 17.7 reels long, which is over 3 miles of film. </li>
                <li>In Skippy, Jackie Cooper couldn't make himself cry while filming a scene, so the director threatened to have Cooper's dog killed. </li>
