            <h2>Origin Stories</h2>
            <h3> Epic</h3>
                <p>About 6 years ago, I was watching my sister play soccer and my parents told us that after the game we would have to make a pit stop to go and get a basketball hoop for our driveway. So, after the game was over, my two siblings and I got into the car and started to drive to th place with the hoop. We drove and drove until we reached this random house and my parents told us to get out of the car. We all did, reluctantly. We were then greated with a heard of tiny little puppies. My parents looked at thr three of us and said "we are getting something a little bit better than a basketball hoop" and we all started to cry from how happy we were.</p>
                <p>They had already picked out which one was ours, she was the shy ones that looked so calm and mellow. We picked her up and took her home with us. We debated on what to name her for over a week. Some of the other runner ups were Galaxy and Honey, but we all agreed that Epic fit the best!</p>
                <p>Although this is not my dog, this is what a day in the life of living with Epic is all about!</p>

            <h3> Turbo and Whiskey</h3>
                <p>My boyfriend had Guinea Pigs growing up and over this last winter break he kept talking about how cute they were. So naturally, images and videos popped up on my Instagram feed and I was hooked. I wanted one so very bad. So on a random Tuesday, we both decided to just go take a look at the selection of pigs that were at Petco. After getting there and only seeing male ones (we wanted girls), we went aross the road to PetSmart. They also only had males and we were devestaed.</p>
                <p>In one last hail mary, we went to Tropic Waters, the only other pet store in EC to look for two girl piggies. After walking in and seeing no cages in sight, we still decided to take a lap around the store.  In the very back corner of the store on the ground was a little cage that was labled "Female Guinea Pigs". We looked at the cage that appeared empty and saw one little fur ball tucked away in the castle hut in the cage. My boyfriend said that there was only one, and since they are pack animals, we needed two. I got down on my hands and knees to look at her, and looked up at him and said "there's two in there". We called a worker over and asked to hold them, and they were so soft and snuggled right into us. We knew that they had to come home with us.</p>
                <p>This is the type of videos that would come across my feed that made me want to be a Guinea Pig mom!</p>
